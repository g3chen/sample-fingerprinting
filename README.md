# sample-fingerprinting

This [SeqWare](http://seqware.github.io/) workflow detects putative sample swaps using alignment files.

##Workflow

The source code for the [sample-fingerprinting SeqWare workflow] is freely available from github at https://github.com/oicr-gsi .

###Decider
For most workflows, the recommended way to configure and launch workflow runs is by using a [decider](http://seqware.github.io/docs/6-pipeline/basic_deciders/). Deciders query SeqWare's metadata repository, looking for appropriate files to launch against.
